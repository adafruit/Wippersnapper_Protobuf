# ds18x20.proto

This file details the API used by hardware running Adafruit WipperSnapper firmware for interfacing with a DS18B20 temperature sensor.

**Note about design and implementation**: WipperSnapper defines a pin as a OneWire bus. Only one DS18x20 sensor is allowed per pin. To use multiple DS18x20 sensors, use multiple pins.

## Sequence Diagrams

### Create: DS18x20

Request from a broker to:
1) Initialize a OneWire bus on a desired pin
2) Initialize and configure a DS18x20 Maxim temperature sensor on the OneWire bus

```

### Delete: DS18x20

Request from a broker to:
1) De-initialize a DS18x20 object's driver
2) Release the pin from being used as a OneWire bus

### Sensor Event: DS18x20

Message containing data and metadata from a DS18x20 sensor.

```mermaid

autonumber

Device->>IO: Ds18x20DeviceEvent
Note over Device,IO: This message contains i2c.SensorEvent,<br>which contains the sensor's value unit. <br> Since a device may have >1DS18X20 <br>sensor, it also contains the sensor's pin <br>for addressing
```
