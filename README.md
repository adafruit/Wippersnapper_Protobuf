# Code Generation

This repository includes an automated script for generating the required protocol buffer wrapper messages.

Nanopb header files for Arduino may also be generated by installing `protoc`, cloning this repository, and invoking:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
protoc --plugin=nanopb/generator/protoc-gen-nanopb -Inanopb/generator/proto --proto_path=./proto ./proto/wippersnapper/*/*/*.proto --nanopb_out=./arduino_out --nanopb_opt=-I./proto --nanopb_opt=-t
```
